Project 1:
This basic Calculator is different from anyother who is teaching on youtube.
                Because
They just ask user for 1,2,3,4 (1 = +, 2 = -, 3 = *, 4 = /) so the user confuses
                 but
This programme contains the real ones for the ease of the user.

Project 2:
This 'guess the number' game is is very joyful and has made
     with easier and understandable code.
